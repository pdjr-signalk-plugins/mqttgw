# pdjr-skplugin-mqttgw

Exchange data between MQTT and Signal K.

## Background

I use
[Home Assistant]()
as a general purpose domestic automation system on my boat and it is a
no-brainer to think about interoperability with Signal K.
MQTT provides a nice mechanism that is well supported by Home
Assistant.

This plugin allows export of Signal K data paths to MQTT and import
of MQTT topics into Signal K.

## Description

**pdjr-skplugin-mqttgw** provides a service for both exporting data to
and importing data from a specified MQTT server.

Frequency of export, retention behaviour and support for meta data can
be set globally and on a per-item basis.

If you are unfamiliar with MQTT then consult this
[MQTT documentation](https://mqtt.org).

## Configuration

The plugin recognises the following configuration properties.

<table>
<tr><th>Property&nbsp;name</th><th>Value&nbsp;default</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
broker
</td>
<td><pre>
{
  "url": "mqtt://127.0.0.1",
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
}
</pre></td>
<td>
Connection and authentication details for the MQTT broker which must be configured to suit your local installation.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>broker.url</td><td></td><td>Broker url.</td></tr>
<tr><td>broker.username</td><td></td><td>Username for client connection on *broker.url*.</td></tr>
<tr><td>broker.password</td><td></td><td>Password for *broker.username* on *broker.url*.</td></tr>
<tr><td>broker.rejectUnauthorised</td><td></td><td>Optional boolean value that does what exactly?</td></tr>

</table>

publication        | (none)  | Optional object configuring MQTT publication settings for *broker*. |
subscription       | (none)  | Optional object configuring MQTT subscription settings for *broker*. |

The 'broker' object consists of the following properties which define
the connection to an MQTT broker.

Property           | Default | Description |
:----------------- | :------ | :---------- |
url                | (none)  | Required URL of MQTT server (for example, "mqtt://192.168.1.1"). |
username           | (none)  | Required login-id of a user with read and write privileges on the MQTT server at *url* |
password           | (none)  | Required password for *username* on the MQTT server at *url*. |
rejectunauthorised | true    | Optional boolean value that does what exactly? |

The 'publication' object defines the Signal K paths that should be
published on the broker and some default settings for publication.

Property           | Default    | Description |
:----------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
root               | 'signalk/' | Required string prefix to apply to all published topic names. |
paths              | []         | Required list of objects each of which specifies a Signal K path that will be published. |
retaindefault      | true       | Optional boolean specifying the default topic retention type. |
intervaldefault    | 5          | Optional integer specifying the default publication interval in seconds. |
metadefault        | false      | Optional boolean specifying whether or not path meta data should also be published. |

Each item in 'publication.paths' is characterised by the following properties.

Property           | Default | Description |
:----------------- | :------ | :---------- |
path               | (none)  | Required string specifying the Signal K path to a value that should be published on the MQTT server. |
topic              | (none)  | Optional string specifying the topic name to which *path* should be published (see below). |
retain             | (none)  | Optional boolean overriding *publication.retaindefault*. |
interval           | (none)  | Optional integer overriding *publication.intervaldefault*. |
meta               | (none)  | Optional boolean overriding *publication.metadefault*. |

If *topic* is not specified, all periods in *path* will be replaced by
slashes and the result contatenated to *publication.root* to generate a
topic name for publication.

Values published to the generated topic name are generated by applying
JSON.stringify() to the Signal K path value.

If publication of meta data associated with *path* is requested then
it is published on "*topic-name*/meta".

The 'subscription' object defines the topics on the MQTT broker that
should be imported into Signal K together with some default subscription
settings.

Property           | Default | Description |
:----------------- | :------ | :---------- |
root               | 'mqtt.' | Required string prefix to apply to the Signal K path name of all subscribed topics. |
topics             | []      | Required list of objects each of which specifies an MQTT topic and how it should be received into the Signal K data store. |

Each item in *subscription.topics* is characterised by the following properties.

Property           | Default | Description |
:----------------- | :------ | :--- |
topic              | (none)  | Required string specifying the name of a topic on the MQTT server. |
path               | (none)  | Optional string specifying a Signal K path where data received on *topic* should be saved (see below). |

If *path* is left blank, then all slashes in *topic* will be replaced by
periods and the result appended to *subscription.root* to generate a
Signal K path name.

## Operation

The plugin must be configured to suit local and user requirements
before it can enter production.
